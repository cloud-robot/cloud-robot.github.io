<p>QGroundControl desktop versions can install PX4 Pro or ArduPilot firmware onto controller boards. By default QGC will install the current stable version of the selected autopilot, but you can also choose to install beta builds, daily builds, or custom firmware files</p>

<p>First select the Gear icon (Vehicle Setup) in the top toolbar and then Firmware in the sidebar.</p>

<p>For rover purpose choose ArduRover xxx</p>

<p><img src="/img/in-post/qc_firmware_3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the OK button to start the update.</p>

<p>The firmware will then proceed through a number of upgrade steps (downloading new firmware, erasing old firmware etc.). Each step is printed to the screen and overall progress is displayed on a progress bar</p>

<h3 id="1-qx7-not-able-to-bind-x8r">1. QX7 not able to bind X8R.</h3>
<p>If the binding process is correct the X8R lef light should be green. However sometimes the light is solid red which means the bind failed.  check another article for this issue.</p>

<h3 id="2-qx7-not-able-to-control-motor-or-steering">2. QX7 not able to control motor or steering.</h3>
<p>If the binding between X7 and X8R is successful (green led) but motor or steering not working, check another article for this issue.</p>
